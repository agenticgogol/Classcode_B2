    "## Understanding Query Routing in RAG Applications\n",
    "### What is Query Routing?\n",
    "- Query routing (also called intelligent routing or query classification) is the process of dynamically directing queries to different retrieval systems, knowledge bases, or processing pipelines based on the query's characteristics, intent, or domain. Instead of using a one-size-fits-all approach, query routing ensures each query gets handled by the most appropriate specialized system.\n",
    "### When is Query Routing Done?\n",
    "Query routing occurs at the very beginning of the RAG pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query Analysis → Classify query type, intent, and domain\n",
    "- 🔄 Query Routing → Direct to appropriate knowledge base/pipeline\n",
    "- Specialized Retrieval → Use domain-specific retrievers\n",
    "- Generation → LLM uses optimally retrieved context\n",
    "- Optional Fallback → Route to general system if specialized fails\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Query Routing Matters\n",
    "Different types of queries benefit from different retrieval strategies and knowledge sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Technical queries → Code repositories, API docs\n",
    "- Company policies → Internal knowledge bases\n",
    "- General knowledge → Web search or general corpus\n",
    "- Real-time data → Live APIs or databases\n",
    "0 Personal queries → User-specific data stores"

    "## Key Differences in Output Quality\n",
    "### Without Query Routing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generic Results: All queries use the same general knowledge base\n",
    "- Lower Relevance: Documents lack domain-specific expertise\n",
    "- Missed Opportunities: Specialized knowledge bases remain underutilized\n",
    "- Inconsistent Quality: No optimization for different query types\n",
    "\n",
    "### With Query Routing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specialized Results: Each query gets directed to the most appropriate knowledge base\n",
    "- Higher Precision: Domain-specific documents with expert-level content\n",
    "- Optimal Resource Utilization: Right knowledge base for the right query\n",
    "- Context-Aware Responses: Results tailored to query intent and user needs"
